This is a very simple Collatz Conjecture calculator. 

The Collatz Conjecture, also commonly referred to as the 3N+1 problem, is a mathematical conjecture that states that if you take any positive integer N and apply the following steps repeatedly, you will eventually reach the number 1:

1. If N is even, divide it by 2.
2. If N is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1.

Despite being tested for a vast range of numbers and always leading to 1, a general proof that this process works for all positive integers remains elusive.

I decided to host this little HTML program I'd made for this a while back on Github. The lack of an online calculator for such a simple yet impossible mathematical theorem led me to make this, and since then I've improved on it. And now I'm throwing it out into the world! Have fun!
